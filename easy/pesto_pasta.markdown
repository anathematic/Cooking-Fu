## Ingredients
- 400g Pasta (generally Farfalle or Penne)

### Optional extras _(stuff I should have added)_
- Fresh basil

- Pine nuts

## Steps
- Chop up onions, garlic, mushrooms and chicken
- Throw onions / garlic in the pan, add mushrooms once onions start to go a little transparent
- Cook pasta in the background
- Add in chicken with some of the water from pasta, simmer a little
