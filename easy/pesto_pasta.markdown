# Pesto Pasta

## Summary
Basil chicken pasta stuff, super simple (jar sauce ftw)

## Ingredients
- 400g Pasta (generally Farfalle or Penne)
- 1 brown onion
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 1 bbq chicken (whole is good)
- 100g mushrooms
- 1 jar of pesto (Barilla was in my fork of this)
- 1 whole red or green chilli (for those who like a bit of kick in their pesto ;)

### Optional extras _(stuff I should have added)_
- Fresh basil
- Pepper 
- Italian Parmasen
- Pine nuts

## Steps
- Chop up onions, garlic, chilli, mushrooms and chicken
- Throw onions / garlic in the pan, add mushrooms once onions start to go a little transparent
- Throw in 2/3 of the chopped chilli
- Cook pasta in the background
- Add in chicken with some of the water from pasta, simmer a little
- Drain pasta, throw in jar + pasta
- Stir a heap till it looks about right
- Top with the rest of the fresh chilli as a garnish

## Estimated cooking time: about 15 minutes
